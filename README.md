* I plan on using Github to mostly publish my code so that people can use and build upon it. This can hopefully get my name out for possible employers to see. Github will also be helpful for getting through my college courses. By making my work public I can present my code to professors, students, or anyone who is interested. 
* This assignment will display an old program I made in python for a course I took 2 years ago.
